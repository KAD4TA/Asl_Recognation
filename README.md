# Asl Recognition
In this project, I did a sign language classification study with the data I created over the 24-class American sign language alphabet. The data set in this study consists of 3 sections as training, validation and test, each section has 24 different sign language alphabets and the number of data is 500 from each letter, totalling 12000 training data, 1200 validation and 1200 test data, 50 from each letter for validation and test data. In this classification problem, I created a classification method using the if else structure in a piecewise manner so that the value with the largest prediction value in the list is the classification result of that letter. I used various libraries to classify this model. For the capture and processing of this library, the mediapipe library was used for the detection of the hand in the image and the mobilenet deep learning model was used with the transfer learning method. The reason I used this model was that mobilenet was faster and more efficient.
